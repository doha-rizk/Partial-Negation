# Partial-Negation
 ---

### This notebook is a demonstration for the Partial Negation operator in quantum computing using qiskit and qasm simulator. It was used in this [paper](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003491617300817). 

I implemented the first part of the paper, where I've proved the probability of measuring either 1 or 0 using partial negation. This method has many advantages and in the upcoming notebooks I shall implement some important applications.
